importance of evaluating data quality across the ML lifecycle:\n","* When building your first ML model, you often have no data and have to invest in annotation resources to get labels\n","* Dataset labels can be noisy as they are collected from a variety of different sources.\n","* Real world evolves (drift) and so should the datasets you’re using to train models (to make sure they evolve along with it). \n","\n","[Great Expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/) is a popular Python library for validating data in Machine Learning pipelines. It contains several built-in Expectation types to configure tests, as well as integrations with common data structures used to store datasets (e.g. Pandas dataframes, CSV files, MySQL databases etc). We will be using this library to define and run some data quality tests for our dataset.

Can you design some useful invariance behavioral tests? \n","\n","2. **Embedding drift based data quality checks across Training/Test datasets** -- in step 3, we wrote some data quality tests. If we wanted to check for drift in embedding space between training and test data, how might we construct a data quality test for this? Hint: The distribution of euclidean distance between pairs of embeddings within the training, and between the training and test dataset should be “almost the same”\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"name":"MLOps Week 2 project (Prajwal Srinivas).ipynb","provenance":[{"file_id":"1i5O6SPOWD_rUKRdoifDQZT822uPzLBQS","timestamp":1659262015084}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
